With the helps of <font color="red">Hooks, Jenkins, Plugins & Trigger</font>: once the
 Developer changed the code and commits:-
<br>
<ul>
    <li>The Code got pushed to Github (with the help of Hooks)</li>
    <li>It is downloaded to the Jenkins workspace (when Jenkins finds a new version of code
 is available on github)</li>
    <li>And then auto Deployment takes place (with the help of Jenkins)</li>
    <li>Now the new Website is available to clients</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
All these above steps are automated and agile just by using a Jenkins Job. <br>
