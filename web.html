With the helps of <font color="red">Hooks, Jenkins, Plugins & Github hook Trigger</font>: once the
 Developer changed the code and commits:-
<br>
<ul>
    <li>The Code got pushed to Github (with the help of Hooks)</li>
    <li>Github alerts Jenkins about new code and ask to start the Job (using Webhook)</li>
    <li>Jenkins goes to github and clones the new code to its workspace & deloys to the webserver.
 (with the help of Github Plugins)</li>
    <li>Now the new Website is available to clients</li>
</ul>
