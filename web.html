<h1 style="color:white">This is the sample Website</h1>
<hr>

With the helps of <font color="red">Hooks, Jenkins, Plugins & Remote Trigger</font>: once the
 Developer changed the code and commits:-
<br>
<ul>
    <li>The Code got pushed to Github (with the help of Hooks)</li>
    <li>Developer alerts Jenkins about new code being pushed and it needs to start the Job.
 (again using Hooks)</li>
    <li>Jenkins goes to Github(any VCS) and clones the code & deploys on the webserver.</li>
    <li>Now the new Website is available to clients</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
All these above steps are automated and agile. <br>

Note:- One of best method that I have learned till now beacuse it is not limited to any 
SCM
<br>
- As Github Hook Trigger was specifically for Github.
